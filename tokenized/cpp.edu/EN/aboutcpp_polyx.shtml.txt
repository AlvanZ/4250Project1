With
PolyX,
You
Learn
…​
Through
Discovery
Look
for
answers
to
problems,
then
look
for
new
problems
that
need
solving.
Don’t
just
find
solutions,
find
new
ways
to
approach
every
challenge.
Embrace
your
curiosity,
hone
your
creativity,
and
engage
with
mentors
who
help
you
do
both.
Together,
there’s
no
end
to
what
you
can
discover.
From
Diverse
Perspectives
Deeper
understanding
requires
many
ways
of
thinking.
Open
your
mind
to
the
experiences
of
others
—
your
professors,
mentors,
fellow
students
and
alumni
—
and
you’ll
learn
to
look
at
challenges
in
new
ways.
And
when
you
bring
your
own
perspective
to
the
table,
you’ll
challenge
those
around
you
to
see
in
new
ways
as
well.
By
Doing
Immerse
yourself
in
experiences
that
stay
with
you.
Enter
the
field
knowing
you
have
what
it
takes
to
succeed
and
the
experience
to
back
it
up.
It
all
comes
from
living
it
firsthand
through
hands-on
and
collaborative
learning
surrounded
by
a
supportive
culture
of
care.
For
Impact
When
you
change
your
world,
you
change
the
world
around
you.

growth
you
experience
at
Cal
Poly
Pomona
has
a
ripple
effect,
elevating
not
only
your
potential,
but
your
family’s
and
your
community’s.
You’ll
make
a
difference
in
your
chosen
career
field,
in
your
community
and
beyond.
For
Life
When
you
learn
how
to
learn,
the
impact
echoes
forward.
You’ll
know
how
to
adapt
to
and
navigate
an
ever-changing
world,
wherever
your
career
takes
you.
