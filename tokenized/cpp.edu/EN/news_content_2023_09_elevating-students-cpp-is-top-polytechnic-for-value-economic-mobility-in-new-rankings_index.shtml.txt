Cal
Poly
Pomona
is
the
highest-ranked
polytechnic
university
in
two
new
rankings
for
value
and
helping
students
improve
their
socioeconomic
status.
The
university
was
the
top
polytechnic
university
and
No.
14
in
the
West
on
Washington
Monthly’s
“
2023
Best
Bang
for
the
Buck
Rankings:
West
”
list.
The
publication
weighed
each
institution’s
graduation
rate
for
all
students,
percentage
of
students
with
Pell
Grants
and
student
loans,
net
price,
racial/ethnic
and
gender
composition
of
the
student
body,
and
how
well
each
institution
serves
a
large
number
of
students
from
low
and
middle-income
families.
The
median
earnings
of
alumni
10
years
after
entering
college
was
listed
as
$65,569.
Cal
Poly
Pomona
is
also
the
highest-ranking
polytechnic
university
on
the
nonprofit
Third
Way
“
2023
Economic
Mobility
Index
”
ranking.
The
EMI
data
table
showed
CPP
at
No.
30
in
the
nation.
The
Third
Way
analysis
focused
on
“institutions
that
offer
strong
return
on
investment
for
students
with
the
greatest
financial
need
—
providing
real
economic
mobility….
[They
help]
students
not
only
access
college,
but
also
get
across
the
finish
line.”
At
Cal
Poly
Pomona,
over
70
percent
of
undergraduate
Broncos
receive
some
form
of
financial
aid
to
assist
them
on
their
path
to
success.
During
the
2022-23
academic
year,
$246
million
was
awarded
to
students
through
a
variety
of
financial
aid
programs
including
grants,
loans,
scholarships,
fellowships,
veterans’
aid,
and
work
study.
In
general,
an
undergraduate
student
who
qualifies
for
financial
aid
will
have
their
tuition
fees
fully
covered
by
grant
aid
if
their
family’s
total
income
is
less
than
$80,000.
