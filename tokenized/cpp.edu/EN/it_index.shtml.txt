2-Step
Authentication
To
protect
your
privacy
and
secure
your
Bronco
account,
Cal
Poly
Pomona
requires
2-step
authentication
for
all
accounts.
This
process
will
verify
your
identity
before
allowing
access
to
campus
systems.
The
CSU
and
Cal
Poly
Pomona
are
using
the
DUO
application,
a
third-party
smartphone
app,
for
the
authentication
process,
also
known
as
Multi-Factor
Authentication
(MFA).
The
DUO
app
sends
a
push
notification
to
your
device
when
you
log
in
to
verify
your
identity.
Visit
the
2-step
authentication
page
to
protect
your
BroncoIdentity.
