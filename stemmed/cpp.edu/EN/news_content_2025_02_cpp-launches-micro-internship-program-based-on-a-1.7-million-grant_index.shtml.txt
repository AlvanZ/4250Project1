debbi
tanaka,
micro-internship
program
coordinator,
also
share
her
thought
on
the
import
of
micro-internship
relat
to
cal
poli
pomona’
philosophi
of
learn
by
doing.
“it
fit
well
with
learn

do
becaus
you'r
not
onli
learn
in
class,
but
you'r
actual
earning,
and
you'r
make
an
impact
on
the
compani
you'r
work
for,”
said
tanaka.
“it
boil
down
to
the
application.
you
can
learn
as
much
as
you
like,
but
if
you'r
not
appli
it
to
anything,
then
it'
not
make
an
impact
to
your
profession
develop
as
much
as
you'd
want
it
to.
with
the
micro
internship,
you
have
the
opportun
to
appli
what
you'r
learning,
and
you'r
learn
on
the
spot.”
ultimately,
innov
incub
hope
to
institution
thi
program
beyond
the
current
3-year
grant
fund
and
have
compani
pay
for
the
task

the
program
also
hope
to
expand
it
reach
to
more
students,
with
goal
of
enrol
1000
student
in
year
two
and
1500
student
in
